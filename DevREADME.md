# About FreshStart
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind FreshStart came from witnessing the struggles faced by people living in high cost of living areas or experiencing homelessness. We wanted to create a platform that empowers individuals to take control of their lives by providing them with personalized job opportunities and resources to relocate to more affordable areas within the US.

## What We Learned
Throughout the development of FreshStart, we gained valuable insights into various technologies, data analysis, and user experience design. We learned how to integrate different technologies such as JavaScript, Express.js, CockroachDB, Node.js, React.js, and SCSS/MUI to create a seamless and user-friendly webtool. Additionally, we explored machine learning algorithms to offer personalized job recommendations, as well as data visualization techniques to effectively communicate cost of living differences.

## How We Built It
We built FreshStart using an agile methodology, working in sprints to iteratively develop features and improve the platform based on user feedback. We started by designing the user interface using React.js and SCSS/MUI, then developed the backend with Express.js and Node.js. For data storage, we used CockroachDB, which allowed us to efficiently store and manage user profiles and job data. We also leveraged various APIs and data sources to provide job market analysis, cost of living comparisons, and other valuable resources.

## Challenges We Faced
During the development of FreshStart, we faced several challenges:

Integrating various technologies: Ensuring seamless interaction between different technologies required careful planning and coordination among our team members.
Data accuracy: Finding reliable data sources for cost of living comparisons and job market analysis proved to be challenging, as we wanted to provide users with the most accurate information possible.
Balancing features and simplicity: It was essential to strike a balance between offering a comprehensive set of features while maintaining a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
Accessibility: Ensuring that the platform was accessible to users with disabilities required research and implementation of best practices.
Despite these challenges, we persevered and successfully developed FreshStart, a powerful webtool that helps users find new job opportunities and start fresh in more affordable living areas.
